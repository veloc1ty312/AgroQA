[1] Q: When should I start irrigating V6 corn in hot, dry weather?
A: In hot, dry weather, you should start irrigating V6 corn as soon as you observe signs of water stress or when the soil moisture levels drop below optimal for corn growth. The corn's water use rate increases significantly during the reproductive and rapid growth stages, so timely irrigation is crucial to prevent yield loss. According to the data, "yield response to irrigation by corn is excellent," indicating that well-managed irrigation can significantly enhance corn yields, especially in dry conditions [5]. Regular monitoring of soil moisture and weather conditions will help determine the best timing for irrigation.

[2] Q: Give a concise checklist for monitoring water stress signs in V6–V10 corn during a heat wave.
A: To monitor water stress signs in V6–V10 corn during a heat wave, follow this checklist:

1. **Check Soil Moisture**: Use a Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to measure plant moisture tension levels, ensuring that the plants are not stressed. A well-watered plant will have a lower canopy temperature compared to stressed plants [4].

2. **Observe Leaf Color and Turgor**: Look for signs of wilting or leaf curling, which indicate water stress. Healthy corn should maintain turgor pressure in its leaves.

3. **Monitor Growth Stages**: Be particularly vigilant during critical growth stages, as corn is most susceptible to water stress during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth [1].

4. **Temperature and Humidity Checks**: Ensure that the ambient temperature is not excessively high, as corn is sensitive to heat stress, especially when combined with water stress [2].

5. **Frequent Inspections**: Conduct weekly checks for changes in temperature, moisture, and any musty odors that may indicate unfavorable conditions [2]. 

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and manage water stress in your corn during a heat wave.

[3] Q: Using ET-based methods, outline a simple 10-day irrigation schedule for corn in hot, dry weather (include a matplotlib chart).
A: To outline a simple 10-day irrigation schedule for corn in hot, dry weather using ET-based methods, one would first calculate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) based on local weather data. For instance, if the ETc is around 5-6 mm per day, as observed in various studies, irrigation should be scheduled to replace this amount. A practical approach would be to irrigate every 3-4 days, applying approximately 15-20 mm of water each time to ensure adequate moisture without over-irrigating, which can reduce field application efficiency [2][4]. This method aligns with the principles of irrigation scheduling, which emphasize the importance of matching water application to crop needs based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions [5].

[4] Q: Summarize key irrigation scheduling recommendations specifically from the Kansas State Corn Production Handbook.
A: The Kansas State Corn Production Handbook emphasizes the importance of effective irrigation scheduling to optimize corn yields. It advises against using plant condition as a basis for scheduling, stating that "watching for stress signs in corn is the poorest of methods for scheduling" as damage occurs before stress signs are evident [1]. Instead, it recommends methods such as "regular direct measure of soil water or ET-based irrigation scheduling," which have shown better results in yield and water savings compared to stage-of-growth scheduling [2]. Additionally, it highlights the critical need for water during the tasseling and silking stages, suggesting that if sufficient water cannot be applied during these periods, alternative crops should be considered [2].

[5] Q: What yield response to irrigation (bushels per inch of water) does the Kansas State Corn Production Handbook report?
A: The Kansas State Corn Production Handbook reports that well-managed irrigated corn can produce, on average, "10 to 15 bushels for each inch of water" applied [2]. This yield response highlights the effectiveness of irrigation in enhancing corn production under optimal management conditions.

[6] Q: When should irrigation be reduced or terminated near maturity according to the Kansas State Corn Production Handbook?
A: Irrigation should be reduced or terminated as corn approaches maturity, particularly during the reproductive stage, which is critical for yield. The Kansas State Corn Production Handbook indicates that "a water shortage at tasseling and silking can ruin yield potential" [4]. It is recommended to manage soil water carefully, as "watching for stress signs in corn is the poorest of methods for scheduling" [5]. Therefore, proper scheduling based on soil moisture or evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to avoid yield-limiting water stress as the crop matures.

[7] Q: How do I use the KANSCHED2 ET-based irrigation scheduling tool—what inputs are required and how often should I update them?
A: To use the KanSched2 ET-based irrigation scheduling tool, you need to input daily reference evapotranspiration (ET) values, rainfall amounts, and gross irrigation amounts whenever irrigation occurs. The tool calculates crop evapotranspiration (ETc) based on these inputs, which helps determine when and how much irrigation water to apply [1][5]. It is recommended to update these inputs daily to maintain an accurate assessment of soil water content and irrigation needs [3].

[8] Q: Explain the checkbook method workflow as implemented by KANSCHED2 for scheduling irrigation.
A: The checkbook method workflow in KanSched2 for scheduling irrigation operates similarly to financial accounting, where soil water is treated as the valued commodity. In this method, "the debit is crop water use while credits are rainfall and irrigation" [1]. The program tracks crop evapotranspiration (ETc), rainfall, and soil water storage to determine when irrigation is necessary and how much water should be applied. By monitoring the root zone soil profile water balance, KanSched2 helps users make informed irrigation decisions, potentially reducing costs and improving yields [2][3].

[9] Q: From UNL guidance, what’s the recommended approach to begin irrigation for corn on silt loam under hot, dry conditions?
A: Under hot, dry conditions, the recommended approach to begin irrigation for corn on silt loam is to ensure that the first irrigation depths account for any rainfall and to apply light irrigation to limit deep percolation losses. It is crucial to monitor corn water use rates, which can average between 0.15 and 0.20 inches per day during early growth stages, and to irrigate adequately to prevent water stress, especially during critical periods like silking and pollination when water use rates can peak at 0.32 inches per day [1][5]. Additionally, maintaining good residue cover can help minimize soil evaporation and improve water retention [3].

[10] Q: Using UNL guidance (EC2008-2023), list steps to estimate daily crop water use (ETc) and convert to inches for scheduling.
A: To estimate daily crop water use (ETc) in inches for scheduling, first calculate the reference crop ET (ETr) using an atmometer or similar device. Then, apply the crop coefficient (Kc) specific to the crop being assessed using the equation ETc = ETr x Kc [2]. For example, if the ETr is determined to be 2.10 inches and the Kc for soybeans is 1.10, then ETc would be calculated as ETc = 2.10 in. x 1.10 = 2.31 inches [1]. It is advisable to perform these calculations at three- to seven-day intervals for improved accuracy [1].

[11] Q: From UNL guidance (G2245-2014), how should I adjust irrigation when forecast rainfall is 0.5 in over the next 48 hours?
A: When forecast rainfall is expected to be 0.5 inches over the next 48 hours, it is advisable to adjust your irrigation schedule accordingly. Since irrigation typically reduces inter-annual variability in soil-water extraction, you should consider delaying or reducing irrigation to prevent over-saturation of the soil, especially if the forecasted rainfall meets or exceeds the crop's water needs. As noted, "consistent irrigation scheduling will reduce year-to-year variability in crop growth" and help manage water effectively [3]. Additionally, using soil moisture sensors can help determine the current soil moisture status and guide your irrigation decisions [2].

[12] Q: From UNL guidance (EC2007-2014), provide typical soil water holding capacity values I can use for a quick field calculation.
A: For quick field calculations, typical soil water holding capacity (AWHC) values can vary based on soil texture. The management allowable depletion (MAD) for corn is generally reported to be around 50 percent, but it is recommended that irrigations be triggered at a 30-40 percent MAD level to prevent the last portion of the field from dropping below 50 percent of AWHC [3]. Additionally, the AWHC is defined as the difference between field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) [5]. For specific values related to different soil textures, refer to NebGuide G783, which discusses the operational characteristics of soil moisture sensors [1].

[13] Q: Give fertigation do’s and don’ts for nitrogen through a center pivot on corn.
A: When applying nitrogen through fertigation on corn using a center pivot, it is essential to time the application correctly. Nitrogen should be applied early, around the five-leaf stage, to avoid weather conditions that could prevent application later on [1]. Additionally, ensure that nitrogen is available during the rapid uptake period, which begins about 25 days after emergence [4]. Avoid applying nitrogen on sandy soils before spring to reduce the risk of leaching loss [1]. Lastly, monitor the crop's nitrogen needs closely, as excessive nitrogen can lead to environmental losses and reduced efficiency [5].

[14] Q: Provide guidelines for irrigation system capacity (in/day) needed to meet peak corn ET under hot, dry conditions.
A: To meet peak corn evapotranspiration (ET) under hot, dry conditions, an irrigation capacity of approximately 0.35 inches per day is recommended. However, in certain soil types with high water-holding capacity, a capacity of 0.25 inches per day may suffice due to the buffer provided by stored soil water. It is crucial to consider that "irrigation capacity is the ability of a specific water supply rate to meet the peak demands of a growing crop" [1]. Additionally, proper irrigation scheduling is essential to ensure that the timing and amount of water applied align with the crop's needs and soil moisture conditions [2].

[15] Q: What are typical application efficiencies for center pivot, sprinkler, and drip systems and how do they affect net irrigation depth?
A: Typical application efficiencies for center pivot and lateral move sprinkler systems range from 85 percent to 90 percent, with a well-managed system achieving up to 90 percent efficiency, requiring a gross application of 11 inches to deliver a net application of 10 inches [2]. Drip irrigation systems generally have higher efficiencies, often exceeding 90 percent, but specific values can vary based on management and environmental conditions [5]. The efficiency of these systems directly impacts the net irrigation depth, as higher efficiencies reduce the amount of water needed to achieve the desired soil moisture levels, minimizing waste and optimizing water use [3].

[16] Q: Summarize FAO irrigation scheduling principles relevant to maize (Kc, stages, and soil water balance).
A: FAO irrigation scheduling principles for maize involve understanding the crop's water requirements throughout its growth stages, typically defined by a crop coefficient (Kc). The Kc values vary during different growth stages, reflecting the plant's increasing water needs as it matures. Additionally, maintaining an appropriate soil water balance is crucial, which involves monitoring available soil moisture and ensuring it does not fall below the allowable depletion level. For maize, the design root zone depth is often around 0.70 to 0.75 meters, and the allowable soil moisture depletion is set at 0.50, indicating that irrigation should be applied before the soil moisture drops significantly below field capacity [3]. This approach supports effective water management and enhances crop yield [2].

[17] Q: From FAO materials, list maize crop coefficients (Kc) by growth stage and explain how to compute ETc from ETo.
A: The crop coefficients (kc) for maize at different growth stages are as follows: initial stage - 0.4, crop development stage - 0.9, mid-season stage - 1.2, and late and harvest stage - 1.2 [3]. To compute the crop water requirement (ETc), the equation used is ETc = ETo x kc, where ETo is the reference evapotranspiration and kc is the specific crop coefficient for the respective growth stage [1][2].

[18] Q: Using FAO guidance, outline a simple water balance worksheet for daily irrigation scheduling for maize.
A: To outline a simple water balance worksheet for daily irrigation scheduling for maize, begin by determining the effective rainfall (Pe), groundwater (Ge), and stored soil water (Wb) available for the crop. The net irrigation requirement (In) can be calculated using the formula In = ETcrop - Pe - Ge - Wb, where ETcrop is the evapotranspiration for maize [2]. Next, assess the total available soil water over the rooting depth and calculate the allowable soil depletion to ensure optimal growth [3]. Finally, schedule irrigation based on the running soil water balance, ensuring that irrigation is applied when soil moisture levels fall below the allowable depletion threshold [1].

[19] Q: Provide steps to calibrate a boom sprayer’s nozzle flow rate and verify uniformity using catch cans.
A: To calibrate a boom sprayer’s nozzle flow rate and verify uniformity, first clean the filters and nozzles to ensure accurate measurements. Then, perform a catch test by collecting the flow from a single nozzle for one minute using a graduated container and a stopwatch. Measure the distance between nozzles to ensure uniform spacing, as "consistent spacing between nozzles is critical for uniform pesticide applications" [4]. If deviations are found in nozzle spacing, make necessary adjustments before proceeding with pesticide application [2].

[20] Q: How does nozzle pressure affect flow rate and droplet size for field sprayers? Provide equations or rules of thumb.
A: Nozzle pressure significantly affects both flow rate and droplet size in field sprayers. Higher operating pressures tend to produce smaller droplets, which can lead to issues such as wind drift and uneven application patterns. As noted, "excessive operating pressure produces small droplets, or fogging, and irregular turning of sprinkler heads" [5]. Conversely, too low of a pressure can result in larger droplets and poor distribution, creating a "doughnut-shaped spray pattern" that affects plant growth [5]. To adjust flow rates, operators can change the speed of the sprayer or the nozzle size, as "slower, you are putting out more; faster, you are putting out less" [2].

[21] Q: Using the ‘On-farm Scheduling’ paper from K-State, explain a practical workflow to update irrigation decisions during a heat wave.
A: During a heat wave, a practical workflow for updating irrigation decisions involves utilizing real-time evapotranspiration (ET) data to adjust irrigation schedules. Farmers can employ the KanSched program, which "was developed and tested to schedule irrigations using daily inputs of reference evapotranspiration" along with rainfall data to maintain a field water balance [1]. By monitoring local weather conditions and crop water needs, adjustments can be made to irrigation amounts, ensuring that crops receive adequate moisture without over-irrigating, which can lead to inefficiencies [2]. This approach allows for timely and efficient irrigation management, particularly critical during periods of high temperature.

[23] Q: Give a concise plan for deficit irrigation at late vegetative stages that minimizes yield risk.
A: To implement deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stages while minimizing yield risk, focus on applying water strategically during periods when the crop is less sensitive to water stress. This involves withholding water during these less critical growth stages, as deficit irrigation is defined as “the intentional under irrigation of crops with the objective of either water conservation or increased profitability over the long-term” [2]. It is essential to monitor soil moisture and crop health closely to ensure that the crop does not experience excessive stress, which can lead to reduced yields [2]. Additionally, consider the specific water needs of the crop at this stage to optimize the amount of water applied without compromising overall yield potential [1].

[24] Q: How can I use visible plant stress in corn as an indicator for irrigation timing, and what cautions apply?
A: Using visible plant stress in corn as an indicator for irrigation timing can be misleading. Corn often shows few obvious signs of water stress until it is too late, as "the damage is done before the stress signs are obvious enough to prevent yield-limiting water stress" [1]. While corn can serve as a moisture stress indicator plant, it typically shows stress several days before other crops, which may not be timely enough for effective irrigation management [5]. Therefore, relying solely on visual signs of stress is not recommended; better methods include regular direct measurement of soil water or ET-based irrigation scheduling for improved yield and water savings [1].

[25] Q: Create a 7-day irrigation plan for corn facing a forecast heat wave; assume daily ET ~0.30–0.40 in and no rainfall (include a matplotlib chart).
A: To create a 7-day irrigation plan for corn during a heat wave with estimated daily evapotranspiration (ET) of 0.30 to 0.40 inches, you should first calculate the total water loss over the week. Assuming an average ET of 0.35 inches per day, the total water loss would be approximately 2.45 inches over 7 days. 

Given that the total available water in the soil is around 2.2 inches, and considering a lower limit of 50% available water, you would need to replace about 1.1 inches of water to maintain optimal conditions for the corn crop [1]. Therefore, you could schedule irrigation to apply approximately 1.1 inches over the week, ideally split into two applications of about 0.55 inches each, spaced out to ensure the soil remains adequately moist [4].

[26] Q: What are typical peak daily ET rates for irrigated corn in the U.S. Plains and how should I plan starting capacity?
A: Typical peak daily evapotranspiration (ET) rates for irrigated corn in the U.S. Plains can approach 0.50 inches, although such high rates are unusual to sustain for more than several days, with average rates around 0.35 inches per day [2][5]. When planning irrigation capacity, it is essential to ensure that the irrigation system can meet these peak demands, which can be calculated based on the formula provided: "Irrigation Capacity = GPM × (450 a-in/hr/gpm) × hours of daily irrigation operation/day" [1]. Additionally, considering soil water reserves can allow for a lower irrigation capacity in certain soil types, where an irrigation capacity of 0.25 inches per day may suffice [1].

[27] Q: Explain how to compute net vs. gross irrigation given soil depletions and system efficiency; include a numeric example.
A: To compute net versus gross irrigation, first determine the net irrigation water requirement, which accounts for soil depletions and auxiliary water needs. This is calculated as: 

Net Irrigation Water Requirement = ET - P + Ground water contribution + Auxiliary water needs. 

Next, to find the gross irrigation requirement, divide the net irrigation amount by the irrigation system efficiency. The formula is: 

Gross Irrigation Requirement = Net Irrigation Water Requirement / Seasonal Irrigation Efficiency [1][3]. 

For example, if the net irrigation requirement is 1.5 inches and the system efficiency is 75%, the gross irrigation requirement would be 1.5 inches / 0.75 = 2.0 inches [2].

[28] Q: If rainfall of 0.25 in is forecast tomorrow, how should I adjust today’s planned irrigation under an ET-based schedule?
A: If rainfall of 0.25 inches is forecasted for tomorrow, you should adjust today’s planned irrigation by considering the expected contribution of this rainfall to the crop's water needs. Since rainfall can significantly affect irrigation schedules, it is important to account for it: "Assuming that substantial rainfall was recorded right after irrigation was completed, then such an event does not contribute to the crop water requirements as it will be lost to deep percolation" [4]. Therefore, if the rainfall occurs before irrigation is due, it can reduce the amount of water you need to apply today. Additionally, ensure that your irrigation scheduling program is updated with this forecast to improve efficiency and accuracy in determining how much water to apply [3].
